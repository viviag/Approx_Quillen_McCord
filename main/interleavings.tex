Basic definition is the following:

\begin{definition} {\cite[Definition 3.1]{Zomorodian05}}\\
  \define{Persistence complex} is a family of chain complexes $C_{\star}^{i_0} \xrightarrow{f_{i_0}} C_{\star}^{i_1} \xrightarrow{f_{i_1}} C_{\star}^{i_2} \xrightarrow{f_{i_2}} \ldots$ where $I$ is the linearly ordered set of indices and $f_i$ are chain maps. We call maps $f=(\ldots,f_i,\ldots)$ \define{the structure maps} of a persistence complex.
\end{definition}

These objects naturally arise in experiments. If we consider $I$ as a time, this is a structure we obtain while observing some dynamic structure which can at any time be represented by a chain complex.\\

\begin{definition}
  Let $R$ be a ring. \define{Persistence module} is a family of $R$-modules $M^i$ with homomorpisms $\phi_i :: M^i \to M^{i+1}$ as the structure maps. If $R$ is a field it is natural to use notion of \define{persistence vector space}.
\end{definition}

Example of a persistence module is given by homology modules of persistence complex $C_{\star}$ (\define{persistent homology}). $H_i^j(C_{\star}) = H_i(C_{j})$, maps $\phi_j$ are induced by $f_i$.\\

\begin{definition}
  Persistence complex (module) is of \define{finite type} over $R$ if all components of complexes (modules) are finitely-generated as $R$-modules and all $f_i$ ($\phi_i$) are isomorphisms for $i > m$ for some $m$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Persistence complex (module) is of \define{finitely presented type} over $R$ if all components of complexes (modules) are finitely-presented as $R$-modules and all $f_i$ ($\phi_i$) are isomorphisms for $i > m$ for some $m$.
\end{definition}

Note that by construction homology of complex of finite type is a module of finite type. It follows from the fact that quotient of finitely generated module by finitely generated module is finitely generated. Analogous statement fails for complexes of finitely presented type.\\

\begin{definition}
  Assume $I$ is a semigroup. Then \define{graded module} over $I$-graded ring $R$ is an $R$-module $M$ together with a decomposition $M = \bigoplus_{j \in I} M^j:\; \forall i \in I\, R_i \cdot M^j \subset M^{j+i}$
\end{definition}

Graded modules over $R$ form a category. Maps $\phi$ between modules $M$ and $N$ such that $\phi(M^j) \subset N^j$ for all $j$ in indexing set are morphisms in this category.\\

There is a well-known theorem:

\begin{theorem} {\cite[Theorem 3.1]{Zomorodian05}}\\
  Category of persistence modules of finite type over Noetherian ring with unity $R$ indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is equivalent to category of graded finitely generated $R[t]$-modules.
\end{theorem}

It is proven in {\cite{Corbet18}}. Authors provide generalization which is more suitable for our needs.\\

\begin{theorem} {\cite[Theorem 21]{Corbet18}}\\
  Let $R$ be a ring with unity and $G$ be a monoid with linear order. Then the category of finitely presented graded $R[G]$-modules is isomorphic to the category of $G$-indexed persistence modules over $R$ of finitely presented type.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark} ~ \par
  The most practically reasonable examples are given by considering corollary Theorem with $G$ is either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$. These examples represent continuous and discrete time in observation with ability to reason about the past.
\end{remark}

This equivalence is required to introduce a measure of similarity between persistence modules. It is essential since in applications we have to accept error in experimental data and we must decide whether observed homology modules are close enough to initial hypothesis or not.

\begin{definition} {\cite[Definition 2.7]{GS16}}\\
  Let $M$ and $N$ be graded $R[G]$-modules, $f : M \to N$ be a homomorphism of modules. Then $f$ is called \define{$\varepsilon$-morphism} if $f(M^j) \subset N^{j+\varepsilon}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  Note that $0$-morphism is a morphism in category of graded modules over $R[G]$.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $\mathbb{R}$ be a ring with unity and $G$ a monoid with linear order. Then for any graded $R[G]$-module $M$ and any $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{G}$ there exists morphism $Id_{\varepsilon}(a) = t^{\varepsilon}a$.
\end{proposition}

This proposition follows from definition of monoid ring and does not require any assumptions on $R$ and ideals in $R[G]$.

\begin{definition}
  Graded modules $M$ and $N$ are called \define{$\varepsilon$-interleaved} ($M \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} N$) if there exists pair of $\varepsilon$-morphisms $(\phi : M \to N,\;\psi : N \to M)$ (\define{$\varepsilon$-interleaving}) such that $\phi \circ \psi = Id_{2\varepsilon} : N \to N$ and $\psi \circ \phi = Id_{2\varepsilon} : M \to M$.\\
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  There follows that $M \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} N$ implies $M \stackrel{\alpha}{\sim} N$ for any $\alpha > \varepsilon$ since for $\varepsilon$-interleaving $(\phi, \psi)$ we have $\alpha$-interleaving $(Id_{\alpha - \varepsilon} \circ \phi, Id_{\alpha - \varepsilon} \circ \psi)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  We denote as \define{$\varepsilon$-equivalence} relation with the following properties:\\
  For any $M$, $N$, $L$, $\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon_1$, $\varepsilon_2$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $M \stackrel{0}{\sim} M$.
    \item $M \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} N$ is equivalent to $N \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} M$.
    \item if $M \stackrel{\varepsilon_1}{\sim} N$ and $N \stackrel{\varepsilon_2}{\sim} L$ then $M \stackrel{\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2}{\sim} L$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  $\varepsilon$-interleaved non-negatively graded modules are $\varepsilon$-equivalent.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition} {\cite[Proposition 2.13]{GS16}}
  \label{epstriv}
  Condition $M \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} 0$ is equivalent to condition $t^{2\varepsilon}M = 0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
  Any $\varepsilon$-equivalence induces an extended pseudometric on its domain. This pseudometric is defined as $d(X,Y) = min\{\varepsilon \in I\;|\;X \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} Y\}$. For graded modules this pseudometric is called interleaving distance. {\cite[Definition 2.12]{GS16}}\\
  We shall refer to this general pseudometric as to approximation distance since we do not want to overload the term, however we do not give another examples expect for interleaving distance. For deeper evaluation of this construction see {\cite{deSilva18}}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{ops}
  Let $0 \to M \to L \to N \to 0$ be a short exact sequence of non-negatively graded modules. Then the following properties hold:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $M \stackrel{\varepsilon_1}{\sim} 0$ and $N \stackrel{\varepsilon_2}{\sim} 0$ then $L \stackrel{\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2}{\sim} 0$. {\cite[Proposition 4.6]{GS16}}
    \item If $L \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} 0$ then $M \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} 0$ and $N \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} 0$.
    \item If $M \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} 0$ then $L \stackrel{2\varepsilon}{\sim} N$. {\cite[Proposition 4.1]{GS16}}
    \item If $N \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} 0$ then $M \stackrel{2\varepsilon}{\sim} L$. {\cite[Proposition 4.1]{GS16}}
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{pf}
  Second statement of the lemma requires the proof. Denote non-trivial maps in s.e.s as $i$ and $q$.\\

  Then $i(t^{2\varepsilon}a) = t^{2\varepsilon}i(a) = 0$ for any $a \in M$. $i$ is injective. Hence by Proposition \ref{epstriv} $M \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} 0$.\\

  On the other side $0 = q(t^{2\varepsilon}a) = t^{2\varepsilon}q(a)$ where $q$is surjective. Hence $N \stackrel{\varepsilon}{\sim} 0$.
\end{pf}
