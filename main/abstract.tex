Combinatorial topology has recently been successfully applied to data analysis. One approach is to compute homology groups of some persistence complex constructed by experimental data and try to classify some objects by them. However complexity of computation of persistent homology is high enough to limit practical usage of the approach.\\

There is a question of how to construct persistence complex with same homology as initially given with smaller dimension. Some of the complexes arise from dynamics of some partially ordered set by nerve construction. In this paper we prove Quillen-McCord theorem (Quillen fiber lemma) in the setting of persistent homology. It can possibly be used to reduce persistence complex built from poset to a smaller one.\\

While proving the theorem we develop a setting convenient to prove approximate statements about persistence objects. This setting is based on notion of interleaving distance and representation theorem of persistent homology.
