Value of error propagation multiple in the result may probably be decreased with alternative proof using spectral sequences at the cost of some restriction on structure maps of posets. Here we outline results of Govc and Scraba on error propagation in one specific spectral sequence associated to cover.

Assume persistence simplicial complex $S$ is a filtered complex (assuming either ascending or descending filtration with any compatible structure maps) and there exists open covering $\mathcal{U}$ compatible with filtration. Then there exists a spectral sequence called Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence which converges to $H_{\star}(S)$. {\cite[Theorem 2.30]{GS16}}\\

Let all sets in filtered cover $\mathcal{U}$ be $\varepsilon$-acyclic with all intersections between them be $\varepsilon$-acyclic. This is a representation of the definition of $\varepsilon$-acyclic cover. {\cite[Definition 3.2]{GS16}}\\

Sets and all their nonempty intersections in any covering form a poset with inclusion being an order relation. Nerve of this poset is called \define{nerve of a covering} and we shall denote it as $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{U})$.\\

There hold the following propositions:

\begin{proposition} {\cite[Corollary 5.2]{GS16}}\\
  If $\mathcal{U}$ is an $\varepsilon$-acyclic cover of $X$, then for all $i$ $E^2_{i,0}$ of Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence and $H_{i}(\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{U}),\mathbb{F})$ are $2\varepsilon$-interleaved as graded modules.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition} {\cite[Theorem 7.1]{GS16}}\\
  Let $D$ be dimension of $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{U})$. Then for all $i$ $H_i(X,\mathbb{F}) \stackrel{(4D+2)\varepsilon}{\sim} H_i(\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{U}),\mathbb{F})$.
\end{proposition}
